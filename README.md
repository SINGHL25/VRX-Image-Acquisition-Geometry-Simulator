Key Features Implemented:



3D Simulation Mode: Interactive Three.js scene showing camera setup, vehicle movement through trigger line, adjustable camera tilt (0-35°), viewing angles up to 45°, and visual focus cone with depth-of-field indicators
Dynamic Controls: Real-time sliders for mounting height (3-8m), trigger distance (5-20m), focus distance, camera tilt, viewing angle, and lane width with live simulation controls
Live Calculations: Automatic computation of slant distance, focus distance, viewing angle, depth of field, image clarity %, misread risk %, and distance tolerance using industry-standard formulas
Interactive Charts: Three analytical views showing accuracy vs tilt angle, focus sharpness vs distance, and image quality vs viewing angle
AI Assistant Panel: Contextual Q&A system that explains camera geometry terms, suggests optimal configurations, and answers what-if questions based on current parameters
Training Mode: 7-step guided tutorial covering introduction, mounting height, trigger distance, camera tilt, focus calibration, viewing angle verification, and system validation with checkpoints and pro tips
Knowledge Base: Searchable database of 10+ technical terms with formulas, definitions, and the three reference diagrams you provided, plus bookmarking functionality
Dashboard: Multi-lane KPI widgets showing image clarity %, misread risk, distance tolerance, and geometry efficiency with 24-hour performance trends and lane-by-lane status reports


The simulation animates vehicle movement, triggers detection when crossing the trigger line, and visualizes the camera's focus cone in real-time. All formulas from your reference diagrams are implemented accurately.
